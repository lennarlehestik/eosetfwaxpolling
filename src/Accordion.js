            <p>After 2/3 fund managers have voted, rebalancing function can be triggered.</p>
            <p>There is no limit on how many times and how often the fund can be rebalanced. Only criteria is to have 2/3 of managers voted.</p>
            <p>By clicking on Chart, a chart is displayed that shows current allocation (%) of each token and how youâ€™ve currently voted.</p>
            <p>To have a token in the list of tokens that could be voted for, fund managers have to make a proposal to cet.f msiggers.</p>
